# NALA
Artificial Intelligence. Everywhere.

## About Us
NALA is a non-profit organization dedicated to **bringing AI** to pretty much `all common activities` 2T schools, businesses, communities, or even individuals.

### Our Projects
- NALA-Writer : A chrome extension to create essays and text based off from AI. (Closed Beta)
- NALA-Engine : The bases of the whole NALA AI. (Closed-Source)
- NALA-Keras : A modified version of Tensorflow's "KERAS" to analyze text and images. (Closed Beta)
- NALA-Im2Te : An engine that detects the text inside of an image. (Unreleased)
- NALA-Bot : A Discord bot to use all the NALA Engine's features inside of discord. (Unreleased)
- NALA-Lists : A discord bot list. (Unreleased)

### Fun Facts
1. The whole NALA project is based off from Nala, a 7 month old **Australian-Blue Cattle Dog**
2. NALA is powered off entirely off from DONATIONS!
3. NALA was going to mean **Neural Assisted Language Administrator** but that did not go well with us...

## Work With Us
Here at NALA, we are open to MANY ways that you as an individual or professional can help us build this new technology.
